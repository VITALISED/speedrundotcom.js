# speedrundotcom.js

## Very, very WIP and no where near being finished. Don't try to use this unless you're insane

Speedrundotcom.js is a fresh new library on the block that's written in typescript. It's a high level API wrapper for speedrun.com with lots of cool features and all that good stuff.

If you've found this on a whim and want to help out, add me on discord: **VITALISED#7081**

## Todo

These are just random notes I write down, probably won't be here forever. Sooner or later I'll move them to another MD file or ORG file so don't worry :)

- Pagination management
- Caching (maybe, might not need it, but I kind of want it anyway)
- A rework on _fetch to be less reliant on the constructor
- Finish coverage and get those types done! (second time I've written this down now)
